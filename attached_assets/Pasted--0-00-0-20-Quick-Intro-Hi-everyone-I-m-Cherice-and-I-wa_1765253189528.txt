[0:00 – 0:20 | Quick Intro]
Hi everyone, I’m Cherice, and I want to introduce you to Nephra—an AI-powered health companion built for people living with advanced stage kidney disease and the families supporting them.

[0:20 – 1:10 | What the App Does]
Right now, Nephra supports four main functions:
Health Tracking – Patients can log hydration, blood pressure, and other symptoms.


GFR Monitoring – They can view personalized kidney function trends using their estimated GFR.


AI Journal Companion – A daily journal with AI-generated stress support, encouragement, and symptom tracking.


Education & Advocacy – Articles and tools to help patients understand their condition and prepare for transplant conversations and journey.


Nephra brings all of these into one cohesive platform, designed to be simple, accessible, and supportive.

[1:10 – 2:30 | MVP Progress + Accessibility Enhancements]
Since the last version, I’ve focused on accessibility, responsiveness, and accuracy. Here are some of the improvements:
✅ Color Contrast
I’ve updated our UI to meet WCAG standards—text and chat bubbles now meet the 4.5:1 contrast ratio for readability.


⌨️ Keyboard Navigation
Every interactive element, especially in the chat interface, is fully keyboard-accessible.





🦾 Screen Reader Compatibility
Icons like the AI avatar and material icons now include proper ARIA labels.


📱 Responsive Design
We capped chat bubble width at 80%, so text resizes cleanly across devices.


🧮 GFR Calculator Upgrade
It now accepts both mg/dL and μmol/L, with built-in unit conversion logic to keep estimates accurate regardless of format.



[2:30 – 3:40 | Live Demo Walkthrough]
(Begin screen share or walk through clickable prototype)
Let’s take a quick look at what’s working today in the MVP.
Home Dashboard
 Here, patients get an overview of their most recent entries—hydration, blood pressure, symptoms—and their latest GFR estimate.


(Show health summary cards or top-of-page view)
GFR Calculator + Trends
 This is the trend chart where users can monitor their kidney function over time.
 The new calculator lets them enter either mg/dL or μmol/L, and the app handles the math in the background.


(Open calculator form briefly and highlight unit toggle or conversion)
Health Input Tracking
 Logging hydration and blood pressure is fast and simple.
 It saves automatically and updates the trend chart in real-time.


(Show a hydration entry submission and feedback state)
Journal + AI Support
 In the journal tab, users can reflect on their day or symptoms.
 When they submit a journal entry, the AI responds with encouragement or a stress-relief prompt personalized to their health status.


(Demo submitting a journal entry and receiving an AI response)
Accessibility in Action
 Now, I’ll tab through the app to show keyboard navigation.
 You’ll see that each element is focusable and labeled—this is critical for users with motor or vision impairments.


(Tab through interface to highlight focus rings and ARIA-labeled elements)
Responsive Layout Check
 Lastly, I want to note that everything resizes cleanly on mobile and tablet views.
 The app is fully responsive, so no functionality is lost on smaller screens.



[3:40 – 4:00 | Wrap-Up]
That’s where Nephra stands today—functional, accessible, and grounded in the lived experience of kidney patients.

I’m not feeling great today. My head has been hurting alot and my blood pressure has been pretty high.
