Your GFR trend chart and dashboard are showing fallback demo user data (ID 1) instead of your actual user account ID 3.

Even though you are properly authenticated, some components/hooks are still fetching demo data.

Replit guided you to fix a bunch of files to stop hardcoding fallback to demo ID 1.

🔥 Here’s what you need to double-check and finish fixing:
1. In ALL relevant files, you need to:

REMOVE any fallback like userId = 1

Instead, use your real authenticated user ID from the authentication context.

Typically, your real user ID comes from something like:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const { user } = useAuth(); 
const userId = user?.id;
Or if you're using a context like useUser() or similar, that's fine too.

📋 Critical files you must update:

File	What to Check
client/src/components/WelcomeCard.tsx	Use user.id, not hardcoded 1
client/src/pages/TrackPage.tsx	Fetch your data with user.id
client/src/pages/HealthLogging.tsx	Log health data under user.id
client/src/components/HealthCalendar.tsx	Show calendar data from user.id
client/src/pages/HealthTrends.tsx	Render trend data from user.id, not 1
client/src/hooks/useHealthData.ts	When calling APIs, pass user.id, no fallback
🛠 Example Fix
Here’s an example of what your hook or API calls should look like now:

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext'; // Or wherever your auth context is

const { user } = useAuth();

const fetchHealthMetrics = async () => {
  if (!user) return; // safety check
  const response = await fetch(`/api/health-metrics?userId=${user.id}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
No more stuff like:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const userId = user?.id ?? 1; // ❌ REMOVE THIS FALLBACK TO 1
📈 About the GFR Trend Chart
GFR trend WILL NOT appear until:

Your GFR records are properly linked to your userId = 3

The component pulls the metrics using your authenticated ID and no longer ID 1

There are actual historical GFR logs (not just one calculation)

✨ Quick Final Checklist
 Remove userId ?? 1 everywhere

 Use user?.id for API requests, data fetching, and health data saving

 Ensure GFR is logged when you click "Save Health Data"

 Ensure trend graphs query the correct user

 Reload dashboard → you should now see YOUR real health logs and GFR trend
