MVP Plan
North Star Metric- Improved early intervention rate through real-time symptom/GFR tracking. 
🧠 Problem Statement
Kidney patients lack accessible tools that track critical health indicators and emotional well-being, making self-advocacy and treatment navigation overwhelming. Preventable health declines happen due to fragmented support.

Create an accessible, mobile-first app that allows users to log hydration, BP/GFR, and emotional states, with AI-powered support and basic visual trend tracking.
Target users: People managing chronic conditions


Your stake: You’ve lived this — it reflects your needs and others like you


What makes this different: Emotional check-ins + AI advocacy support, simplified for low energy/mobility days
